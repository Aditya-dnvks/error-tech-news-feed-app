This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Application Architecture
The News Feed App is structured as follows:

1. **App.tsx:** The entry point of the application.
2. **src/components/NewsFeed.tsx:** Contains the NewsFeed component that fetches and displays the news articles.
3. **src/components/SwipeButton.tsx:** Contains the SwipeButton component which is a custom swipe control to fetch news.
4. **styles:** Styling for the application components using StyleSheet.

## Core Components
1. **App.tsx:**
   - Sets up the main container and renders the NewsFeed component.
2. **NewsFeed.tsx:**
   - Uses useSWR for fetching news data from a public API.
   - Manages the state to display news articles.
   - Contains the SwipeButton component to trigger news fetching.
3. **SwipeButton.tsx:**
   - Custom swipe control component.
   - Handles swipe gestures to trigger news fetch operation.

## Features
**Custom Swipe Control:** Implemented a custom swipe button that fetches news when swiped to a specific area.
**Data Fetching with useSWR:** Efficiently fetches and caches news data from a public API.
**Responsive UI:** Ensures a user-friendly interface with smooth performance.

## Congratulations! :tada:
